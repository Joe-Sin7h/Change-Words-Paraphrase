# Paraphrase-Generator
It is much similar to a normal paraphraser but the only difference is that it does not change the order of words
in the sentence (syntax of sentence) . It tries to replace suitable words with their most similar word having same 
token and shows a list of similar words. The output can be customised by using side radiobuttons .
The Program uses Nltk for language processing , spacy for word vectors , tkinter and few API to find acronyms .
